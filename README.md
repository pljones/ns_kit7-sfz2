# What is this repo for?

This is a bunch of tools (and a few other files) for creating SFZ 2.0 with Aria Extensions mappings of a set of
drum samples.

What's not included are the samples, as they're commercial and copyright.
You might be able to buy them from https://naturaldrum.com/NDK but I have no association with them.

Also not included are the sample mappings...  Read on...

# So why on earth would I want this?

If you don't use Kontakt (full version) or Halion and you like the idea of a bunch of bash scripts that run on Linux
creating a bunch of files you can load into a free sampler, this may be of some interest.

You can [get the sampler, Sforzando, here](https://www.plogue.com/products/sforzando.html).

You can find out about SFZ 2.0 with Aria Extensions mapping in general, on [sfzformat.com](https://sfzformat.com/).

Look, I won't be offended or surprised if you've already stopped reading...
